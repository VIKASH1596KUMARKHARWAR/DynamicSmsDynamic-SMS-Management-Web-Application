Great! It looks like your script is now running successfully and producing the expected output. Here’s a summary of what’s happening:

The script is correctly receiving the command-line arguments testCountry and testOperator.
It logs and prints the progress of sending SMS messages, simulating the sending process with a sleep timer.
Finally, it logs the completion message as expected.
Next Steps
Check the Log File: Ensure that the sms_script.log file is created and contains the logged messages. You can view it using:

bash
Copy code
cat sms_script.log
Refining the Script: If you plan to add more functionality (like actual SMS sending), consider modularizing your code. You could create separate functions for different tasks (e.g., sending SMS, logging, etc.).

Error Handling: As you develop further, think about adding more robust error handling to manage potential issues (e.g., failed SMS sends).

Testing: Since this is a simulation, when you're ready to integrate with an actual SMS service, ensure you implement and test the API calls correctly.

List All Sessions:

bash
Copy code
screen -ls
Attach to a Session:

bash
Copy code
screen -r <session_id>
Replace <session_id> with the actual ID from your screen -ls output (e.g., 62754.program_India_jio_testScript1).

Detach from a Session: Press Ctrl + A, then D to detach from an attached session.

Terminate a Session: If you need to kill a session, you can do so with:

bash
Copy code
screen -X -S <session_id> quit
3. Debugging Tips
If your script isn’t behaving as expected, consider the following:

Log Output: Keep checking the log file to see any errors or output that might help you diagnose issues.

Script Debugging: You can add more logging within your Python script to capture various states or errors. For example:

python
Copy code
logging.info("This is a debug message")
